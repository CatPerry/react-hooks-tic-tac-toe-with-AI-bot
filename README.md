# Build a Classic: Tic-Tac-Toe Using React Hooks

![React Hooks Tic Tac Toe with AI Bot](https://github.com/CatPerry/react-hooks-tic-tac-toe-with-AI-bot/blob/master/public/React_Hooks_Tic_Tac_Toe.png?raw=true)

This simple app uses the following features

- React Hooks - for a fully functional programming approach
- Componentization - lends toward scaling of game types and app as a whole
- JavaScript methods like concat and splice to accomplish flattening and chunking to get the data to mirror what the API expects
- Limited but exisent built-in accessibility, particularly with buttons as the main interactive element, which can be control with hands-free accessible tools; and nice large font
- Login Form that validates the email address. There's no user, perse, here but I have the email to create a bearer token with.
- Play with the computer! Uses an [Open API backend](https://d9u7x85vp9.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/api-docs/#/)
- JWT Token stored in session storage
- Scss/Sass for extensibility/scability

WIP - Things that arent included but could be:
● Loading spinner
● No finished state/screen, or a “You win” / “AI
wins” or Draw messaging
● No board reset button
● Fix sizing of button vs parent`td` square
● Simple tweks to make it mobile responsive
